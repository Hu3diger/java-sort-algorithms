# WELCOME
**This is an activity for the subject Data Structure of the graduation in Software Engineering**

### :point_right: Atividade 2

This class use the Insertion sort algorithm.

The user can input fifteen numbers (only integers), and the output is the ordenated list and the greatest and lowest value, and how many times each one appears.

### :point_right: Atividade 3

This class use the Selection sort algorithm.

The user can input ten numbers (Real numbers), and the output is the ordenated list and the greatest and lowest value, and how many times each one appears.

### :point_right: Atividade 4 #(NOT COMPLETE AND NOT WORK)

This class use the MergeSort algorithm.

The user can input twenty words, and the output is alphabetically ordenated list and the words what beggining with a vowel

### :point_right: Atividade 5

This class uses the Quicksort algorithm.

The code generate one thousand random numbers and show to the user, and the output is the ordenated list.

### :point_right: Atividade 6 #(IN PROGRESS OF DEVELOP)
